Orientation write up

a few things on that 

1) i have used a bearing system for it 
because of two reasons firstly because i took the spec more as a reference 
and second of all even if it was meant literally i think bearing makes way more sense unless unity aint having it
and i would not know how you wanna represent rotation with xyz floats that mapping would be rly confusing

2) speaking of confusing i have spent way to long trying to explain and write docs for the bearing stuff i should have hopefully brought some light into that but while not overall complex or difficult i can definitely see that it is a bit ambiguous and also but not only because of that a bit complex
